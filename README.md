## Submitting a bug/issue
If you find a bug on OOTracker, or want to request that a feature be added, please submit them in the issues tab.
All submissioned will be reviewed, and bugs prioritized in order of severity.
Unfortunately I can't promise to add all requested features, but unless it's a very obscure feature that nobody will use it is likely to be added eventually.
